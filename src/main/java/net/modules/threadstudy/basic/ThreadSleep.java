/**
 * java.lang.Thread sleep() method can be used to pause the execution of current thread for specified time in milliseconds. 
 * 
 * 1. It always pause the current thread execution.
 * 2. The actual time thread sleeps before waking up and start execution depends on system timers 
 * and schedulers. For a quiet system, the actual time for sleep is near to the specified sleep time 
 * but for a busy system it will be little bit more.
 * 3. Thread sleep doesnâ€™t lose any monitors or locks current thread has acquired.
 * 4. Any other thread can interrupt the current thread in sleep, in that case InterruptedException is thrown.
