/**
 * Runnable vs Thread
 * If your class provides more functionality rather than just running as Thread, 
 * you should implement Runnable interface to provide a way to run it as Thread. 
 * If your class only goal is to run as Thread, you can extend Thread class.
 *
 * Implementing Runnable is preferred because java supports implementing multiple 
 * interfaces. If you extend Thread class, you canâ€™t extend any other classes.
